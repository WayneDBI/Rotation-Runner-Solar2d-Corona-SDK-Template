An endless runner template game, where the world rotates around you!
Jump and Double jump to try and stay on the platforms as the rotate around you. Earn points for every second you can stay alive. For each second that passes the world rotates faster and faster, requiring lightning jumping and timing.

Each rotation of the game sees the blocks change size, width and position making it impossible to guess whats coming next.

From this template there are so many game options and variations you can build.
